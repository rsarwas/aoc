# Data Model:
# ===========
# lines is a list of "\n" terminated strings from the input file
# Each line is the location and velocity of a point light source.
# parsing returns a ((x,y),(vx,vy)) tuple, which will be converted
# to a mutable [x,y,(vx,vy)] list.
#
# Strategy: Divide the location by the velocity to get number of time steps to 
# get to +/-1 (close enough to zero).  The answer does not have to be
# centered on 0,0 but it appears that it is.  Take the average, and apply
# that time step to all locations.  Find the x and y extents.  Try moving
# forward 1 time step.  If the extents shrink, keep stepping until the
# extents are minimal, otherwise, step backwards (apply negative velocity),
# until the minimum is found.  Assuming the minimal X and Y will coincide
# with each other, and with the solution.  If not, visually explore both the
# minimal y and x extents, and all nearby timesteps.
