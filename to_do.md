Unsolved problems: All

## 2018

Unsolved problems: 17 and 20 and above

Issues:

Day 18, part 2:
There are hard coded assumptions in the search for a cycle (game of life problem)
that are based on results with my specific input file. Make the code general
enough to work with any input file

Day 19, part 2:
Problem was solved by reverse engineering the code in my specific input file, and then
writing efficient python code to solve the same problem. I think this was the gist of
the problem, so there is no general fully automated solution. If a different input file
had the same algorithm, with a different limit, it should be possible to automate that
code, but why bother, I can manually just update the limit in my code and be done.

## 2020

No unsolved problems

Problems that have been solved, but need more attention

## 2021

Unsolved problems:

- None

Problems that have been solved, but need more attention

- 2021-19, part1:
  The Transformation sequence is hard coded for the sample and puzzle input. This should be calculated by creating a graph and calculating the shortest path from all sensors to the selected sensor.
- 2021-22, part2:
  4 hours of compute time is too long!
- 2021-23:
  Find fully automated solution. Solved manually (a Towers of Hanoi,
  like problem), find computer solution
- 2021-24:
  Find fully automated solution. Solved by "reverse compiling" the input file
  and then manual analysis and trial and error.
