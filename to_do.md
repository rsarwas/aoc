Problems that have been solved, but need more attention

* 2021-19, part1:
  The Transformation sequence is hard coded for the sample and puzzle input.  This should be calculated by creating a graph and calculating the shortest path from all sensors to the selected sensor.
* 2021-22, part2:
  4 hours of compute time is too long!
* 2021-23:
  Find fully automated solution. Solved manually (a Towers of Hanoi,
  like problem), find computer solution
* 2021-24:
  Find fully automated solution. Solved by "reverse compiling" the input file
  and then manual analysis and trial and error.
